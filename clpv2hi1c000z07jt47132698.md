Hey, fellow coders and enthusiasts! I'm Deerendra, currently a student and an aspiring developer stepping into the vibrant blogging world. This is the first step of an exciting adventure of documenting my coding journey. Join me as I navigate my challenges, celebrate victories, and share insights.

I have always wanted to start a blog but never knew what to write. I wanted a place for myself on the internet. I tried writing a few times but then realized content creation was not my thing.

On the other side, I knew the basics of coding as I learned it in college. I did not dive deep into it. I solved a few questions on coding platforms like HackerRank and Leetcode. I realized I needed to learn Data structures and Algorithms. I started learning DSA, but I was so inconsistent I saw little to no progress.

Instead of creating content, why not document my journey ?!

Inspired by the quote by the famous content creator Gary Vaynerchuk,

> ***Document, don't create.***

Blogging gives me a sense of responsibility. When I say my aspirations and ambitions to thousands of people on the internet, there is no going back. It holds me accountable and keeps me consistent in my journey, which in return helps me in my problem-solving and writing skills. I can soon develop this mindset where I can start and think like a creator.

It also allows me to build connections with like-minded people on the internet which opens doors to other valuable opportunities out there. Community helps a lot in the learning process and by teaching and answering questions, I can reinforce the fundamental concepts I had learned along the way.

By documenting my journey, I will also have something to look back on after a few years, which is a great form of reflection.

Having a blog can also help me stand out among the crowd, which is helpful when employers want to hire me. They can see my journey from scratch and also can connect and know about me beyond my CV.

Documenting is a long-term game that can help you in ways you can't even imagine. Here, I will be sharing what I learn every day, the challenges I face, and how I overcome them, and also some informative posts. Join me in my coding journey and let's grow together.

Feel free to connect with me on these platforms.
